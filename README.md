# Habit-Tracker
A habit tracker website made with html, css, and flask from the Udemy course \
'Web Developer Bootcamp with Flask and Python in 2023' by Jose Salvatierra. \
Here is the [link](https://flask-habit-tracker-91g6.onrender.com/) to the deployed website. It can take a while to load due to the deployment service that I used \
so don't worry if it seems to not be loading for a bit.
